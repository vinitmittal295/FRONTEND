JavaScript is considered as Single Threaded application
becuase it has single call stack matlab ek bar mai ek hi piece of code run kar sakta hai.

Event loop :
non blocking operation, code rukta nahi hai jab function call hota hai
when asynchronous operation is initiated JavaScript can continues excuting other codes while waiting for the 
asynchronous code to complete


callback queues
jab asynchronous operation complete ho jata hai it is placed in the callback queue, event loop bar bar check kar
 karta hai ki call stack 
empty hai ya nahi hai,


promises or async await
built on the top of promises allows asynchronous programming.
